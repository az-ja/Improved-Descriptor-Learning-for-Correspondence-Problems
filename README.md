# Improved-Descriptor-Learning-for-Correspondence-Problems
Master thesis at the University of Stuttgart

In this thesis, suitable image features to solve correspondence problems were computed via Covolutional Neural Networks.
These features are embedded in the Coarse-to-Fine PatchMatch method to estimate the optical flow between the two image.
